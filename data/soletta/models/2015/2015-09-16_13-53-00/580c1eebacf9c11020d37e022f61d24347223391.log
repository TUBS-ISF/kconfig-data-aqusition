+Usage example (in the same machine):
+ * server:
+    $ export SOL_MACHINE_ID="580a3d6a9d194a23b90a24573558d2f4"
+    $ export SOL_FLOW_MODULE_RESOLVER_CONFFILE=light-server.json

+    $ sol-fbp-runner light-client.fbp
+
+Server should print on console light state (it is changed by
+client at each second). SOL_MACHINE_ID must match device_id set
+on client configuration file.

+#
+# TalkBack enables any device to act on queued commands.
+#
+# So in this example we'll have a device
+# used to identify a person and send a command to another device, the
+# smart lock, to open.
+#
+# Here we'll simulate the first device as a single keyboard key and
+# it will add the command "OPEN" to the queue everytime it's pressed
+# (key 'a').
+# It also prints to the console the submitted command.
+#
+# Usage: ./thingspeak-talkback-identify.fbp
+#
+# On other proccess you may run thingspeak-talkback-smart-lock.fbp
+# to consume these commands.
+#
+# Register at https://thingspeak.com or use another server (and
+# update node type options).
+#
+# There you should create a new Talkback. You need the talkback
+# id (not the name) and the API Key. Use these values as
+# options for talkback_add and talkback_execute nodes.

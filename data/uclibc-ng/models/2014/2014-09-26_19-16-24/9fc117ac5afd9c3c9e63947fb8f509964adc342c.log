 	  If you want to compile uClibc with NPTL support, then answer Y.
 
-	  IMPORTANT NOTE!  NPTL requires a Linux 2.6 kernel, binutils
-	  at least version 2.16 and GCC with at least version 4.1.0. NPTL
-	  will not work with older versions of any above sources. If you
-	  ignore any of these guidelines, you do so at your own risk. Do
-	  not ask for help on any of the development mailing lists.

-	  "malloc-simple" was written from scratch for uClibc, and is the
-	  simplest possible (and therefore smallest) malloc implementation.
-	  This uses only the mmap() system call to allocation memory, and does
-	  not use the brk() system call at all, making it a fine choice for
-	  MMU-less systems with very limited memory.  It is rather dumb, and

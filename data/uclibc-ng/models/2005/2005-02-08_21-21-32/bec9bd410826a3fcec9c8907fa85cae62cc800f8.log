 config UCLIBC_HAS_SSP

 	default n
 	help
-	  Adds propolice protection to libc (__guard and __stack_smash_handler).
-	  More about it on <http://www.research.ibm.com/trl/projects/security/ssp> .
-	  To be able to use it, you'll also need a propolice patched gcc,
-	  supporting the -fstack-protector[-all] options. It is a specially patched
-	  gcc version, where __guard and __stack_smash_handler are removed from libgcc.
+	  Add propolice smashing stack protector to the library.
+	  This requires a patched version of GCC, supporting the
+	  -fstack-protector[-all] options, with the __guard and
+	  __stack_smash_handler functions removed from libgcc.
+	  These functions are added to libc instead.

-	  Propolice uses a simplified version of the canary, without accessing

+	  Use gettimeofday(2) to define the __guard without accessing

-	  Propolice uses /dev/erandom as canary source.
+	  Use /dev/erandom to define the guard if /dev/urandom fails (chroot).

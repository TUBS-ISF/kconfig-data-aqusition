 	  Build a shared library libbusybox.so which contains all
 	  libraries used inside busybox.
 
+	  This is an experimental feature intended to support the upcoming
+	  "make standalone" mode.  Enabling it against the one big busybox
+	  binary serves no purpose (and increases the size).  You should
+	  almost certainly say "no" to this right now.

+config CONFIG_BUILD_AT_ONCE

+	help
+	  Normally each source-file is compiled with one invocation of

+	  If you set this option, all sources are compiled at once.
+	  This gives the compiler more opportunities to optimize which can
+	  result in smaller and/or faster binaries.
+
+	  Setting this option will consume alot of memory, e.g. if you
+	  enable all applets with all features, gcc uses more than 300MB
+	  RAM during compilation of busybox.
+
+	  This option is most likely only beneficial for newer compilers

+	  lash is the very smallest shell (adds just 10k) and it is quite
+	  usable as a command prompt, but it is not suitable for any but the
+	  most trivial scripting (such as an initrd that calls insmod a few
+	  times) since it does not understand any Bourne shell grammer.  It
+	  does handle pipes, redirects, and job control though.  Adding in
+	  command editing makes it a very nice lightweight command prompt.

+	  The minix shell (adds just 30k) is quite complete and handles things
+	  like for/do/done, case/esac and all the things you expect a Bourne
+	  shell to do.  It is not always pedantically correct about Bourne
+	  shell grammer (try running the shell testscript "tests/sh.testcases"
+	  on it and compare vs bash) but for most things it works quite well.
+	  It also uses only vfork, so it can be used on uClinux systems.

+	  The watchdog utility is used with hardware or softwate watchdog
+	  device drivers.  It opens the specified watchdog device special file
+	  and periodically writes a magic character to the device.  If the
+	  watchdog applet ever fails to write the magic character within a
+	  certain amount of time, the watchdog device assumes that means the 
+	  system has hung, and it will therefore cause the hardware to reboot.

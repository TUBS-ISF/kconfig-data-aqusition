+	  Activate or deactivate the specified interfaces.  This applet makes
+	  use of either "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command to actually
+	  configure network interfaces.  Therefore, you will probably also want
+	  to enable either CONFIG_IFCONFIG and CONFIG_ROUTE, or enable
+	  CONFIG_FEATURE_IFUPDOWN_IP and the various CONFIG_IP options.  Of
+	  course you could use non-busybox versions of these programs, so
+	  against my better judgement (since this will surely result in plenty
+	  of support questions on the mailing list), I do not force you to
+	  enable these additional options.  It is up to you to supply either
+	  "ifconfig" and "route" or the "ip" command, either via busybox or via
+	  standalone utilities.

-	  Please submit a patch to add help text for this item.
+	    If you leave this disabled, busybox will use the system's password
+	    and group functions.  And if you are using the GNU C library
+	    (glibc), you will then need to install the /etc/nsswitch.conf
+	    configuration file and the required /lib/libnss_* libraries in
+	    order for the password and group functions to work.  This generally
+	    makes your embedded system quite a bit larger.
+
+	    Enabling this option will cause busybox to directly access the
+	    system's /etc/password, /etc/group files (and your system will be
+	    smaller, and I will get fewer emails asking about how glibc NSS
+	    works).  When this option is enabled, you will not be able to use
+	    PAM to access remote LDAP password servers and whatnot.  And if you
+	    want hostname resolution to work with glibc, you still need the
+	    /lib/libnss_* libraries.
+
+	    If you enable this option, it will add about 1.5k to busybox.
